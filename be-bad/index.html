					<h1>Be Bad at What You&nbsp;Do</h1>

						<p>
								I’m Tyler Trotter and I want to talk about being bad at what you do. That’s bad, not as in Michael Jackson bad, but as in doing things poorly. I’m going to make the case you should spend some of your free time on side projects, and that you shouldn’t know what you’re doing half the time while working on those side projects.

								Google is famous for the lavish perks it gives to its employees. Probably the best known of these perks is its 20% rule. Developers get to spend 20% of their time working on their own projects that may later be useful to Google.
						</p><p>
								As this Dilbert comic points out, anybody can get Google’s best perk.
						</p><p>
								In this talk I’m going to sing the praises of side projects because their fun. I also am going to delve into the details of my current side project, a word game web app. As I was putting this talk together, I realized I had to mention Subtle Circus, an e-commerce t-shirt Nate and I started  back in 2010.

								Nate and I were working together designing for the web by day, but we didn’t get much of a chance to work on branding, business promotion, writing legal mumbo jumbo, web development, or internet marketing. All things we got to try our hands at with this project. And we failed. I don’t think we sold a single t-shirt. But I don’t have any regrets because it was fun and we learned a lot.

								Fellow lane-wanderer, Winston Churchill was a painter. He painted this during World War II. He was pretty realistic about his abilities, he knew that his day job commitments, saving the world, made it impossible for him to ever become the best artist in the world. But he nevertheless picked up the brush.

								Of course Winston Churchill thought painting was such a good hobby because it was so different from his day job and taxed different parts of the brain. I end up sitting in front of the computer no matter what. That’s the downside of side projects.

										VC3’s biggest offering is IT managed services, which has nothing to do with me. That’s the big chunk of the pie chart. I am on the web design team and do most of my work there but I also help out on other developer projects and on a web app we build called Cognito Forms.

										Like the previous pie chart indicated, web design is a tiny part of VC3. So there wasn’t much competition but I was either the most photogenic designer or the only other designer is a better photographer than me, one or the other, so I ended up here on the web design portion of the site.

										Most of our clients are small local governments in the Southeast. So for example, we do Sumter’s site as well as Wake Forest, NC’s site as well as a lot of town’s close by you’ve never heard of.

									Here is a site I designed for Isle of Palms. We usually work on projects solo. We’ll ask our fellow designers for critiques and get help with technical questions, but otherwise we have a lot of freedom over our projects. We don’t have project managers so we also deal with clients a lot. For example, I drove down to Isle of Palms and spoke with several people in city hall about what they wanted in a website for this projects.
							</p><p>
									If something breaks, someone from city hall will probably call me and ask me to fix it. It isn’t as bad as it sounds. It is a good way to stay in touch with how your work is being used and abused in the real world.
							</p>
							<p>
									These websites don’t usually take any hardcore custom development. Most governments have the same needs so we make sure our content management software can accommodate those needs. Usually we’ll write some custom JavaScript, but that’s it.

								I spend most of my time on government websites, but I also do a lot of work on the design of Cognito Forms which  is a web app that allows Joe Shmoe to drag and drop fields into an online form and then embed that form on his website. It went live around 2013 shortly before I came to VC3.
						</p>
						<p>
								In addition to designing the site, I’ll make illustrations for new features they implement and I get to talk a lot about Google Analytics data and the results of A/B tests on the home page.

								So now that you have a pretty good idea of my day job let me tell you how my current side project is the same but different.
						</p>
						<p>
								Since the beginning of the year I’ve been working on a word game web app that I’ve named Riddled. I’ve been wanting to make a word game for a while. I love word games and it seemed like an easy enough project to tackle. Granted, it isn’t very original, but I had some original ideas within this well-worn word game path and besides, originality is over-rated.

							<p>
									It is similar to Catch Phrase but if you’re not familiar with it let me explain. Players split into two teams. One player from one team holds a phone, tablet, any thing that can display Riddled and gives hints to his or her teammates to get them to guess the words being displayed. Let me demonstrate. Pretend only I can see the word being projected.

								This kind of backend code was a stretch for me but it was more familiar than the database and command line stuff I had to delve into to get everything working. I won’t bore you with the details, but suffice it to say that there is quite a bit of data you would want to save even on a simple word game like this. All of it has to go in the database and there is an art to how to put it in.

								Once I needed to get it live on the internet I put it on a Linux server which I interface with on the command line. I have no clue what’s going on and have to Google at every step to do anything, but I feel like a hacker, which is cool. For example, I was able to get Linux to backup and zip up my database every hour and also delete super old backups. That’s pretty cool and something you need to think about when you’ve put a lot of work into the data.

								Right now I’m trying to figure out how to get people to go to Riddled using Search Engine Marketing. Here is an ad I have running on Bing Ads. My idea is to add niche words and then market them to niche groups, which makes advertising cheaper, and I think, more effective. This is an ad I currently have running targeting Mormons who try to keep Monday nights reserved for family time. They call it Family Home Evening and often families will play games together.

					<h1>Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
								I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.” That’s wrong. If we actually followed that advice we would never do anything. Everything I’ve ever done right was preceded by me doing it wrong. I think a better adage would be, “Anything worth doing, is worth doing poorly.”
						</p>
						<p>
								In my career of designing and building websites I’ve never done anything right the first time. And I’d never have gotten it right without doing it wrong first. All that to say, wander outside your lane. Riddled may get hacked tomorrow, my database might fail, I’m sure I have lots of bugs in my code, but it exists, and I can always improve it. It is a joy ride in a paint-box.
