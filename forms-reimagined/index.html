                <h2>Forms Reimagined</h2>
                <div class="content__description">Re-building Cognito’s Forms UI from Scratch</div>

                <p>Cognito Forms is an online form builder that allows its users to drag and drop fields on a canvas and, without needing to code, create sophisticated forms that can collect data in smart ways. The resulting form generated is hosted at a Cognito URL as well as available to be embedded on any website. <a href="https://www.cognitoforms.com/Tyler3/WebsiteFeedbackForm" target="_blank">See an example Cognito Form here.</a></p>

                <p>By 2018 the front-end technology forms were built on was dated and the technical debt accrued was due to be paid so a complete refactor was in order.</p>
                
                <h3>The front end of the front end</h3>
                
                <p>I was mainly responsible for the front end of the front end, in other words, the UI. The goal was to recreate the existing forms on newer, better structured, tech, but I also took opportunities to improve things where I could.</p>

                <h3 id="vue-components">Vue Components</h3>
                <p>The dev team decided to use Vue in the refactor. None of us had much experience with any modern JS library but when weighing options the simplicity of Vue tipped the scales.</p>

                <p>Settling on Vue, we then shopped around for an open source component library to use as a jumping off point. Element.io suited our needs best. We eventually forked it so we could customize it to the extent necessary.</p>

                <h3 id="custom-css-properties-theming">CSS Custom Properties & Theming</h3>
                
                <p>Cognito Forms allows its users to customize the look forms they create in a simple style editor. What can’t be styled in this editor can probably be tweaked with CSS if the form creator has the ability and is embedding the form on a website.</p>

                <p>I decided early on that I wanted to use CSS custom properties in the CSS so our forms could be easily customized. For example, with one spacing variable the breathing room of all elements can be adjusted. One variable adjusts the relative speed of all animations. The style editor doesn’t leverage all of these variables, but that is just a simple matter of adding on to the UI. In the meantime, customers can tweak variables if they’re handy with CSS.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately we still supported IE 11 when we first launched V2 and that browser did not support custom variables. However, it was possible, with a polyfill and several headaches, to get them to work in IE 11.</p>

                <h3 id="svg-icons">SVG Icons</h3>
                
                <p>Like so many others at the time, V1 Cognito Forms used a font for icons - FontAwesome, to be precise. I wanted V2 forms to not look generic, but to have custom icons, and even more important, easily customizable icons. From experience I knew that adding icons to a font file is a hassle, but that’s what we needed to do in the past to convey some very specific semantics which weren’t covered by the FontAwesome library. One cool benefit to using SVGs is that now customers can adjust the weight of the icons via a CSS custom property.</p>

                <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3> 
                <p>Many customers need the forms they build to be accessible. I worked hard to ensure forms built with default styles would meet the WCAG AA standard. One big obstacle to this objective was our signature field. In V1, it was impossible to fill out without a mouse or a touchscreen - keyboard-only users would be unable to submit the form if the signature was made a required field. We advised customers concerned about accessibility to not use required signature fields, but I wanted to expand our accessibility to include all of our fields and I saw the V2 upgrade as a good opportunity to do so. Today if a signature is required, the keyboard-only user can tab to the “type” toggle button and then type out a signature in a typeface almost guaranteed to be better than their own cursive. Since our customers aren’t limited to English speakers, users typing in other character sets such as Cyrillic or Chinese, script typefaces which were made for those characters are downloaded.</p>

                  <figure>
                    <img src="/images/v2-signature-draw.png" width="1100" height="718" loading="lazy" />

                  </figure>
                </div>

                <h3 id="responsive-forms">Responsive Forms</h3>
                <p>Of course it's important for our forms, probably built with the desktop in mind, to look good and function well on mobile devices. The fluid nature of user-generated forms makes using CSS media queries based on viewport width impractical. The two variables which are unknowable to us are the width of the container of the embedded form and the content of the form. One of the features customers like about Cognito Forms is their layout flexibility- fields can be laid side to side in as many as 8 columns. But this flexibility is another factor that must be considered when ensuring a good responsive experience. JavaScript, of course, had to be used extensively.</p>

                <h4>Measuring the width of the form</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is used to measure the width of the form at a given time and adds what looks like a meaningless string of numbers to an attribute. This string of numbers allows CSS to be written as if using the yet-to-be-fully-supported container queries.</p>

                <h4>Detecting when content runs out of room</h4>
                <p>Because the content is user-generated, I needed to use JavaScript to detect when content has run out of horizontal space. For example, a rating scale is a table of radio buttons which can easily become cramped depending on the number of options, the wordiness of the questions, and of course the device size. As soon as the rating scale is a pixel too wide to fit without overflowing, it is switched to an alternate component that uses dropdown menus. I used this basic technique throughout the other fields.</p>

                <h3 id="ux-testing">UX Testing</h3>
                <p>With each small decision we made while refactoring came an opportunity to impact the user experience. I created a representative form, being sure to include fields with particularly tricky interfaces, and arranged for several remote test users to complete the form. The UI confused some of these users in small but important ways and we were able to easily improve the usability by making a few tweaks here and there. For example, one field, a combobox, allows the user to pick from a dropdown list but also allows them to write in arbitrary text if their answer is not a listed option. The clues that writing in arbitrary text was possible were too subtle for some testers. After weighing the video evidence we determined that the down arrow indicating a dropdown list was available, was overpowering the flashing cursor indicating the text was editable so we removed the icon when arbitrary text was allowed.</p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Every day lots of work gets done all around the world on interfaces built out of building blocks I helped create. When I reflect on that, I’m very proud of my role on this project. Also, my experience working on this system gave me an appreciation for how complex seemingly simple systems can be. It was fun to be knee-deep in that complexity for a sustained period of time.</p>
