                <div class="content__description">Website design and development for municipal governments&mdash;a key offering of VC3.</div>

                <p>While working on a website for a client, I shepherded the project from kickoff to training my clients on the live site. At the beginning of each new project, I met with clients in order to design a site that suited their needs. Throughout the process, I listened to and responded to their feedback until they were happy. Once the design was settled on I built it on Drupal. Finally, I went to city hall and trained everybody who would be managing the site.</p>

                <h3 id="design-ex-nihilo">Design Ex Nihilo</h3>
                <p>Most small governments don’t have a very defined brand. Some have logos, but many have nothing more than a city seal. This was both a challenge and an opportunity when designing a website. Often I started with a truly blank canvas and developed a site’s look and feel as I went along. I tend to like to push the envelope so it was essential to have good communication with my clients. For example, I designed a home page for Valdosta, GA that looked great, but I was told it looked too artistic. That stung a little&mdash;I was really hoping to implement the design, but it was great feedback and it was no problem to rein the design in.</p>

                <h3 id="innovative-tools">Innovative Tools</h3>
                <p>During my time at VC3 I designed and developed several websites, but some of my favorite projects were for cities that had problems that our basic offering didn't already solve. This allowed me to brainstorm with clients and develop solutions for them that would also expand our offering going forward.</p>

                <p>For one windy city, I wired up a burn permit application form to accept or not accept submissions based on real-time wind speeds. In another example of this, I used open-source shape files and the Google Maps API to allow residents to easily see if they lived within city limits. Finally, I put together a scraping tool that would analyze a website’s content and output a report for us to review with the client. We’d meet quarterly and discuss things like pages with very little copy, or pages that hadn’t been touched in a while, or buttons that merely said “click here” and advise them on how to keep the website looking fresh usable for their citizens.</p>
